At Polyglotas, we believe that learning should be a rewarding and motivating experience. Our gamification system is designed to celebrate your progress and encourage consistent practice. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how you can earn points and build your learning streak.

## Point System

You earn points for various achievements throughout your learning journey. Each point you earn is logged so you can track your progress over time.

## Daily Streaks

Consistency is the key to language learning. Our streak system is designed to motivate you to practice every day.

### How it Works

- **Maintain Your Streak:** Complete at least one practice session (e.g., a phrase pronunciation) each day to increase your streak count.
- **Losing Your Streak:** If you miss a day of practice, your streak will reset to zero.
- **Today's Date:** Streaks are calculated based on the UTC date.

### Streak Bonus Points

To reward your dedication, you earn bonus points for maintaining your streak. The longer your streak, the more points you earn each day.

- **Days 1-7:** **1 point** per day
- **Days 8-14:** **2 points** per day
- **Days 15-21:** **3 points** per day
- **And so on...** For every full week you maintain your streak, the daily point bonus increases by one.
